# Typescript--Builder-Pattern
Real world TypeScript implementation of the builder pattern for building a complex http request object that provides the client with a fluent API.

If you wanted to use it inside of an Angular directive like I am in a real project...

```typescript
scope: {},
        link: function (scope:ISidebarScope) {

            scope.Utils = Utils;
```
